            <p><b>wya</b> is an app that helps you find your friends. Instead of texting
            everyone 'wya' or 'wyd,' just open up <b>wya</b> and see where everyone is doing
            what (if they use the app also ofc).</p>

            <p>This is also a progressive web app (or will be soon), which means that if you
            are viewing this on a mobile device, you can press <i>Add to Home Screen</i> and
            the <b>wya</b> icon will pop up on your screen. This will act almost exactly like
            an app downloaded off the App Store, full with offline functionality and everything.</p>
